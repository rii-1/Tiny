  description:  "This guide details the design, simulation, and submission process for a unique Spike Encoder peripheral for the
TTSKY25a RISC-V Microcontroller Challenge. The Spike Encoder converts 8-bit input values into spike trains,
enabling neuromorphic-style processing in a tiny peripheral."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     64000000  # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Do not change the top module here.  Instead change tt_wrapper.v line 38 to refer to your module.
  top_module:  "tt_um_tqv_peripheral_harness"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
