## What it does

Explain what your peripheral does and how it works

## Register map

Document the registers that are used to interact with your peripheral

| Address | Name      | Access | Description                                                                  |
| ------- | --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x00    | PIXEL     | W/R    | Current pixel intensity (write new pixel value; read back last written)      |
| 0x01    | THRESHOLD | W/R    | Threshold for edge detection (default 20)                                    |
| 0x02    | SPIKE     | R      | Bit0 = Spike detected (1 = spike event, 0 = no spike)                        |
| 0x03    | COUNT     | R      | Spike count (increments each time a spike is detected; resets on system rst) |


## How to test

1. **Simulation:**
   - Run `make SIM=icarus TOPLEVEL=tt_um_tqv_peripheral_harness MODULE=test`
   - Check `tb_spike.vcd` waveform and test logs.

2. **On silicon:**
   - Provide an input rate via SPI register 0.
   - Set threshold via SPI register 1.
   - Enable encoder (bit0=1 of register 2).
   - Observe `spike_out` on the output pin (uo_out[0]).

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - When input > threshold â†’ `spike_out` pulses.
   - When input < threshold â†’ no spikes.

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
